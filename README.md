Project Overview
Netflix offers a vast collection of movies, TV shows, and documentaries from around the globe. Navigating and recommending content in such a large, diverse catalog poses significant analytical and business challenges.

This project uses Python (with pandas, scikit-learn, etc.) to:

Cleanse and preprocess Netflix title data.
Engineer advanced features from both structured and textual data.
Apply unsupervised learning (clustering) models to discover natural content groupings.
Evaluate clusters, visualize distributions, and interpret their business significance.
The project demonstrates a real-world, end-to-end data science approach from raw data to actionable insights—ideal for portfolios and practical demonstration.

Dataset
Source: Dataset has been provided with the project
Shape: 7,700+ entries, multiple columns
Included: Movies and TV Shows with details (show_id', 'type', 'title', 'director', 'cast', 'country', 'date_added','release_year', 'rating', 'duration', 'listed_in', 'description)
Dataset file(s) are included for reference and reproducibility.

Features & Columns
Key Variables:

title: NETFLIX MOVIES AND TV SHOWS CLUSTERING DATASET
type: Movie or TV Show
director, cast, country
date_added, release_year
rating: Age rating (e.g., TV-MA, PG-13)
duration: Run time in minutes or number of seasons
listed_in: Genres
description: Brief summary
Engineered Features:

duration_num: Numeric duration
cast_count: Number of main actors
release_decade: Decade when content was released
TF-IDF vectors: Top genres/topics extracted from content descriptions
Project Pipeline
Data Cleaning
Imputation of missing categorical values (e.g., country, cast)
Capping outliers for features like duration
Text Processing
Lowercasing, removing punctuation, stopword elimination
Lemmatization and TF-IDF feature extraction from listed_in and description
Feature Engineering
New columns for content decade, cast size, and more
Label encoding and one-hot encoding for categorical columns
Scaling & Dimensionality Reduction
Standardization of numeric features
(Optional) PCA for visualization and efficiency
Clustering
KMeans, Agglomerative, and DBSCAN explored
Hyperparameter tuning via silhouette score and elbow method
Visualization
Silhouette score histograms, cluster distributions, and content cluster profiles
Interpretation
Linking clusters back to meaningful content types and business goals
Key Results & Insights
Identified distinct clusters such as “Family Content,” “International Movies,” “Short-format Series,” etc.
Demonstrated how clusters can power targeted recommendations, catalog curation, and marketing campaigns.
Showed the utility of text features (genre/topic scores) in distinguishing subtle content differences.
